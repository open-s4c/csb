        """
        An application is either a builtin benchmark binary from the `bench` directory,
        or an external application/benchmark binary.
        This configuration defines an array of applications, each with their own setup.
        If this array has more than one application.
        each container will run an application from the array in a round robin fashion.
        Represented as a JSON array of objects.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name: str
            The name of the application/benchmark binary.
        path: Optional[Path]
            Specifies the relative path where the benchmark binary/script exists. This is
            relevant to running external benchmarks that do not exist system wide under e.g. in `/usr/bin`.
            Note that the path here should be relative to CSB (project) dir, which is mounted as
            `/home` dir in the containers. When running an external benchmark, place its parent folder under
            the project directory e.g. `CSB/bm-external/will-it-scale`, then specify `path` as
            `bm-external/will-it-scale`.
        operations: list[int]
            A list of integers representing the distribution of operations.
            The sum of all values in the list must be equal to 1024.
            Each index represents a specific operation as defined by the benchmark/application.
            This is only relevant for builtin benchmarks.
        args: Optional[str] = -t={threads} -n={noise} -d={duration} -s={initial_size}
            A string that represents the command line arguments of the application.
            It can contain place holders for dynamic values. Available place holders:
            are `{threads}`, `{noise}`, `{duration}`, `{index}`, and `{initial_size}`.
            They are replaced at runtime with the actual values: number of threads, number of nop instructions following an operation,
            duration of the benchmark in seconds, the index of the execution unit in the current benchmarking run, and initial size of the data structure respectively.
            If any of the above is relevant for the external application they can be used in the args
            string. Otherwise they can be omitted.
        adapter: Optional[Adapter] = {}
            An adapter object.
            This is only relevant for external applications/benchmarks.
        cd: bool = false
            When set to `true`, it changes the current directory to the given `path`, and
            then runs the binary/script with the given `name`. When set to `false` and `path`
            is given, the binary is run from the project directory as `path/name`. Use this
            configuration with caution! This configuration is useful when running external
            benchmarks that require to be run from their own directory, because they use
            relative paths like unix bench.
