# Overall Configuration
 The overall configuration of a benchmark combines the setups of distinct components, such as application details and networking.  Only some components need to specified, as displayed below.  More information on each component is detailed in their own documentations.  
|Type|Optional|JSON Representation|
|---|---|---|
|[BenchmarkConfig](#benchmarkconfig)|:white_check_mark:|`{...}`|
|[Application](#application)|:x:|`[...]`|
|[ContainersConfig](#containersconfig)|:white_check_mark:|`{...}`|
|[Plugin](#plugin)|:white_check_mark:|`[...]`|
|[PlotConfig](#plotconfig)|:white_check_mark:|`[...]`|
|[NicsConfig](#nicsconfig)|:white_check_mark:|`{...}`|

## BenchmarkConfig
General configuration for benchmarks, as well as a collection of system-level metrics (specified under monitors). Represented as one JSON object. 
<br/>***JSON key: "benchmark_config"***
|Field|Type|Optional|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|duration|int|:white_check_mark:|`3`|    Duration of the benchmark in seconds.     JSON example: `"repeat": 3` |
|repeat|int|:white_check_mark:|`1`|    Number of times the benchmark should be repeated.     JSON example: `"repeat": 1` |
|initial_size|list[int]|:white_check_mark:|`[0]`|    The initial size parameter that should be passed     to the benchmark initialization.     JSON example: `"initial_size" : [1, 1000]` |
|noise|list[int]|:white_check_mark:|`[0]`|    How many `nop` operations to run between real     operations.     JSON example: `"noise" : [0, 1000]` |
|exec_env|list[[ExecutionType](#executiontype)]|:white_check_mark:|`["native", "container"]`|    Whether to execute the benchmark in a container or     natively. JSON example: `"exec_env" : ["container", "native"]` |
|monitors|dict[[MonitorType](#monitortype), list[str]]|:white_check_mark:|`{}`|    Monitors to run in the background. |
|threads|[ListConfig](#listconfig)|:white_check_mark:|`{"values": [[1]]}`|    Determines number of threads to run target benchmarks with.     If not provided all applications will be run with 1 thread. |

## Application
An application is either a builtin benchmark binary from the `bench` directory, or an external application/benchmark binary. This configuration defines an array of applications, each with their own setup. If this array has more than one application. each container will run an application from the array in a round robin fashion. Represented as a JSON array of objects.  
<br/>***JSON key: "applications"***
|Field|Type|Optional|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|name|str|:x:||    The name of the application/benchmark binary. |
|operations|list[int]|:white_check_mark:|`[]`|    A list of integers representing the distribution of operations.     The sum of all values in the list must be equal to 1024.     Each index represents a specific operation as defined by the benchmark/application.     This is only relevant for builtin benchmarks. |
|path|Path|:white_check_mark:||    Specifies the relative path where the benchmark binary/script exists. This is     relevant to running external benchmarks that do not exist system wide under e.g. in `/usr/bin`.     Note that the path here should be relative to CSB (project) dir, which is mounted as     `/home` dir in the containers. When running an external benchmark, place its parent folder under     the project directory e.g. `CSB/bm-external/will-it-scale`, then specify `path` as     `bm-external/will-it-scale`. |
|args|str|:white_check_mark:|`-t={threads} -n={noise} -d={duration} -s={initial_size}`|    A string that represents the command line arguments of the application.     It can contain place holders for dynamic values. Available place holders:     are `{threads}`, `{noise}`, `{duration}`, `{index}`, and `{initial_size}`.     They are replaced at runtime with the actual values: number of threads, number of nop instructions following an operation,     duration of the benchmark in seconds, the index of the execution unit in the current benchmarking run, and initial size of the data structure respectively.     If any of the above is relevant for the external application they can be used in the args     string. Otherwise they can be omitted. |
|adapter|[Adapter](#adapter)|:white_check_mark:|`{}`|    An adapter object.     This is only relevant for external applications/benchmarks. |
|cd|bool|:white_check_mark:|`false`|    When set to `true`, it changes the current directory to the given `path`, and     then runs the binary/script with the given `name`. When set to `false` and `path`     is given, the binary is run from the project directory as `path/name`. Use this     configuration with caution! This configuration is useful when running external     benchmarks that require to be run from their own directory, because they use     relative paths like unix bench. |

## ContainersConfig
ContainersConfig represents the configuration for multiple containers. Represented as a JSON object.

|core_count|int|:white_check_mark:|`1`|    Number of cores to assign to each container. |
|name|str|:white_check_mark:||    The base name of the container. |
|image|str|:white_check_mark:|`hub.oepkgs.net/openeuler/openeuler`|    The docker image name to use. |

## Plugin
Plugins are a flexible way to inject additional scripts/processes to be executed at different stages of the benchmark execution. A good example would be to start a client to communicate with a server benchmark before the server starts accepting connections. Represented as a JSON array of objects. 
<br/>***JSON key: "plugins"***
|Field|Type|Optional|Default|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|name|str|:x:||    Name of the script/process to be executed. |

Adapters used to transform the output of an external benchmark into the format understood by the framework: a line of `<key>:<val>;` pairs e.g. `throughput:1000;latency:20;`. If an adapter is used the output of the benchmark is piped to the adapter script. See scripts/adapters for examples.
